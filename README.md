"I developed this web-based stopwatch as part of a project to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea came from the need for a practical and accessible tool to measure the time of various activities."
"During the development of this stopwatch, I used HTML to structure the content, CSS to style the interface, and JavaScript to add the necessary functionality. The stopwatch is fully responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices. I added visual effects and smooth transitions to make the interaction more enjoyable. The project also included centering the stopwatch on the page and implementing intuitive control buttons to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch."
"This project not only reinforced my technical skills but also highlighted the importance of good usability and visual design. The final result is a functional and aesthetically pleasing stopwatch that can be used in various situations. I believe this tool can be useful for both personal and professional use, facilitating time tracking in a simple and efficient way."
